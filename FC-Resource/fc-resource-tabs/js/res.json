But the irony is that the good employee also not willing to leave if they are recognized for what they are doing and well respected for their contribution. One of the main reason for this gap is due to unavailability of tools to understand the employees holistically. Replacement hiring cost may go as much as 3 time cost of their annual compensation, which includes not only compensation but trainings, time to bring the employee on board etc. This cost can be avoided if organizations engage with employees at the right time in a right way. Currently organizations do collect data on their employees from various sources and are not leveraging it to their advantage. With the advent of Big Data technology, organizations can analyse all the data, structured or unstructured, understand their employees holistically. In the current days, all the employees are in one or few social media and talking about their work in some form or other. ',
